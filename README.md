## This is a demo project on IoT. 
Here we have tried to develop crop monitoring system using NodeMCU ESP8266 and Arduino. We have deployed sensors like temperature sensor, soil moisture sensor, light sensor, and water pump as actuator.

We have also used Firebase for realtime data store, for further analysis of the historical data, which will be beneficial for the improvement purpose as well as for training AI/ML model for further inference and decision making process.
